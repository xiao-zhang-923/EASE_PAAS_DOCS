It can robustly, flexibly, and elastically bear various enterprise apps, running on enterprise private clouds, public clouds, and hybrid clouds. It has adopted an open cloud-native app access protocol, empowering internal and external apps of the enterprise. It can effectively bear enterprise data assets and ensure data security. It is the new engine for sustainable digitalization of enterprises and a strong base for digital ecosystem construction.</p><h2 id="overview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>Overview</strong></h2><p>EASE-PAAS is a digital PaaS platform with Kubernetes as its kernel. It abandons the traditional cloud computing architecture and turns to a new architecture with Kubernetes as the cloud kernel, enabling enterprises to use the cloud in an extremely simple way. Users can install any high-availability distributed app on Kubernetes like using a personal computer, with almost no professional delivery and operation and maintenance costs. At the same time, with the unique cluster image capability, users can package any distributed applications into images, freely combine various distributed applications, and easily customize the required applications. The powerful and flexible application market function can meet the diverse needs of various users.</p><h2 id="applicable-scenarios-advantages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#applicable-scenarios-advantages" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>Applicable Scenarios &amp; Advantages</strong></h2><p>EASE-PAAS is a powerful business operation platform that can perfectly support various applications such as Java, Go, Python, PHP, etc., without restrictions on programming languages. The platform provides a stable operating environment for applications and resolves back-end dependencies, such as databases, object storage, and message queues, etc. Further, it can flexibly handle issues such as application configuration management, service discovery, public network exposure, and automatic scaling.</p><h2 id="ease-paas-capabilities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ease-paas-capabilities" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>EASE-PAAS Capabilities</strong></h2><p>üöÄ Application Management: Easily manage and quickly release publicly accessible distributed applications in the app market. üóÑÔ∏è Database Management: Create high-availability databases in seconds, supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. üå•Ô∏è Consistency: Whether it&#39;s public or private cloud, traditional applications can seamlessly migrate to the cloud environment.</p><h2 id="ease-paas-advantages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ease-paas-advantages" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>EASE-PAAS Advantages</strong></h2><p>üí∞ Efficient &amp; Economical: Pay only for containers, preventing resource waste and significantly cutting costs. üåê Universality: Focus on the business itself, no complexity concern, and almost no learning cost. üõ°Ô∏è Flexible &amp; Secure: The multi-tenant sharing mechanism ensures security while achieving resource isolation and efficient collaboration.</p><h2 id="private-cloud" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#private-cloud" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>Private Cloud</strong></h2><p>The entire system is 100% open-source and all source codes can be found on GitHub, which means all the functions of EASE-PAAS public cloud can also be deployed in a private cloud environment to meet your more diverse business needs.</p><h2 id="strong-application-delivery-capabilities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#strong-application-delivery-capabilities" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>Strong Application Delivery Capabilities</strong></h2><p>EASE-PAAS has outstanding Kubernetes lifecycle management and the ability to customize the Kubernetes environment. EASE-PAAS can package the entire cluster and deliver it to the customer environment with one click. All services and businesses can be delivered in its entirety. Different from Docker, which focuses mainly on single-machine images, EASE-PAAS goes a step further and can package the entire cluster or a particular distributed application.</p>',14),r=[s];function o(c,l){return a(),i("div",null,r)}const u=e(n,[["render",o],["__file","produces.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
