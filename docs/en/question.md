1. **How to onboard as an application service provider and initiate application access?**

Start by having your company's administrator account access the Service Provider Center from the top right entry. This will automatically complete your onboarding. Once this is done, the Service Provider Center module will be opened for your organization, granting all company members immediate access, and thus commencing the application access process.



2. **How can we manage organizational members?**

Our platform offers an exclusive IAM module that's tasked to manage members, roles, and authorizations. Company administrators can access this member management page via the IAM module. From here, you can add and manage new organization members.


3. **What's the approach to managing application authorization?**

There two major scenarios with application authorization. Firstly, your company can source applications from the application market for organizational use. Here, company administrators, or users who have exclusive rights over the app can proceed with the authorization. The app can be authorized to users within and outside of the organization. Secondly, when your company has complete ownership of the app. After creating your application through the Service Provider Center, organizational users having application ownership can execute the authorization operations on your application.


4. **How do you acquire an application ID?**

Go to your Service Provider Center and find the pertinent application card under the "Project Management - My Project" section, then access the application details. Proceed to the "Shelf Plan Configuration" tab, you will find the related parameters needed for configuring the OIDC protocol at step 1.


5. **What are the environment requirements when deploying on-premises?**
